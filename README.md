# WebSpiderProj
This repo includes what I practice using spider frame of Scrapy to finish several projects

1. TencentEmployInfo
- Crawl the Employ information from Tencent official employ website
2. Sunshine project
- Crawl every post including title, href, publish date, text and image
- Page turning to crawl more info
- Store data in MongoDB
